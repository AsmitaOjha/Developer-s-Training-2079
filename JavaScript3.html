    <h2>Datatye inference in JS</h2>
    <p>
        Datatype of JS are inferred, this implies that there is no need to babysit for the compiler in order to define the datatypes everywhere.
Further, datatype inference means, just define the value to the variable that we want, and its datatype will be declared according to the nature of value  defined.
Therefore, merely we can say JavaScript is autonomous in nature, means it acts freely.
